- ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile!
- ðŸŒ± In this profile, I have focused on C#, .NET & Entity Framework where appropriate.
- ðŸ’¡ There are three repo's that would be relevant to check if you are visiting from Delta:

1) SimpleCRUD-BookList
 - This is a simple CRUD application utilising C#, .NET & Entity Framework built using a tutorial. It was created to demonstrate my ability to put together a simple .NET & Entity Framework application. This was my first time using ASP.NET & Entity Framework.

2) grandnode2
 - This is a forked repo from an open source shopping cart system built in C# & MongoDB. I have been working on some contributions to the project. Namely, the ability to login via a link sent to the users e-mail instead of their password.

3) Cracking The Coding Interview
 - This is my attempt at the algorithm challenges from the book "Cracking the Coding Interview: 150 Programming Question and Solutions" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. I have listed the question in a comment, and then my answer in a method just below it. As there are 150 total questions, this is still work in progress and I suspect will take some time to be complete.
